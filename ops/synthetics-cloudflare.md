# Public synthetics × Cloudflare bot challenge

## Symptom

`Public synthetics` fails at the first request with HTTP 403 — but only from
GitHub Actions. The same `ops/synthetic-check.sh` returns 200 from dookie and
from a browser.

## Root cause (proven, not guessed)

`aurora.tootie.tv` is proxied through **Cloudflare** (the `tootie.tv` zone;
`dinglebear.ai` is *not* proxied — it answers straight from nginx/SWAG). A
diagnostic run from a GitHub runner captured:

- runner egress IP `52.173.163.133` → `AS8075 Microsoft Corporation` (GitHub
  Actions runs on Azure)
- response: `HTTP 403`, `cf-mitigated: challenge`, body
  `<title>Just a moment…</title>` with `cType: 'managed'`, `cZone: 'aurora.tootie.tv'`
  — a **Cloudflare Managed Challenge**
- the same runner IP with a browser User-Agent → still 403 (so it is not the
  User-Agent)
- the same runner hitting `dinglebear.ai` → 200, `server: nginx` (so it is
  specifically the Cloudflare layer, not the origin or the app)

Cloudflare challenges the request because it comes from a hosting-provider ASN
(Azure). `curl` cannot solve a JS challenge, so every HTTP check 403s.
Residential IPs (dookie, a browser) are not challenged, which is why it passes
everywhere except CI.

## Fix — narrow, header-matched Skip rule

Keep every check on the real public path (Cloudflare + TLS + edge, exactly what
a *public* synthetic should test). Let only this monitor through the bot
challenge, by a shared secret it carries in a header. This is a single-secret
match, not an IP/ASN allowlist — no broad WAF bypass.

Two coordinated parts:

### 1. Repo (this PR)

- `ops/synthetic-check.sh` sends `x-aurora-synthetic: $AURORA_SYNTHETIC_TOKEN`
  on every request when the env var is set (backward-compatible: unset → no
  header → unchanged, so local runs and the un-proxied `dinglebear.ai` step are
  unaffected).
- `.github/workflows/synthetics.yml` passes
  `AURORA_SYNTHETIC_TOKEN: ${{ secrets.AURORA_SYNTHETIC_TOKEN }}` to the
  `aurora.tootie.tv` step only.

### 2. GitHub secret + Cloudflare rule (operator — one time)

Generate one token, set it in both places:

```bash
# generate + set the GitHub Actions secret (the workflow reads this)
TOKEN="$(openssl rand -hex 24)"
gh secret set AURORA_SYNTHETIC_TOKEN --repo jmagar/aurora --body "$TOKEN"
echo "Cloudflare rule value: $TOKEN"   # paste into the rule below, then clear scrollback
```

In the Cloudflare dashboard for the **tootie.tv** zone →
**Security → WAF → Custom rules → Create rule**:

- **Field / expression:**
  `(http.request.headers["x-aurora-synthetic"][0] eq "<TOKEN>")`
- **Action:** `Skip`
- **Skip:** check **Super Bot Fight Mode** (and **Bot Fight Mode** if shown);
  also skip **Security Level** to be safe.
- Deploy, and place it above other custom rules.

(Equivalent API path: create/patch the zone's
`http_request_firewall_custom` ruleset with an `action: "skip"` rule whose
`action_parameters.products` include `["bic","hot","securityLevel","uaBlock",
"zoneLockdown"]` / SBFM as available. The SWAG DNS-01 token cannot do this —
it lacks firewall scope — so use the dashboard or a firewall-scoped token.)

## Verify

After both parts are in place, re-run the workflow and confirm green:

```bash
gh workflow run synthetics.yml --repo jmagar/aurora
gh run watch "$(gh run list --workflow synthetics.yml --limit 1 --json databaseId --jq '.[0].databaseId')"
```

## Alternative (rejected)

Pointing the checks at the origin over Tailscale would dodge Cloudflare, but
then the synthetic no longer tests the public edge or its TLS — the whole point
of a *public* synthetic. The TLS check already survives the challenge on its own
(openssl reads the cert at handshake time, before the HTTP 403), so only the
four HTTP checks need the header.
