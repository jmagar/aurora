# Install AS node so every one of the ~93k node_modules files is *created* owned
# by node. Chowning them afterwards is what made the dev image take 30+ minutes:
# on overlayfs a chown cannot just touch metadata, it forces a copy-up of each
# file into the upper layer — 1.8G duplicated, on a Docker root backed by ZFS.
# Measured: `RUN chown -R node:node /pnpm /app` = ~19min and still going, versus
# ~4min for every other step in the build combined.
# Chowning the two directories is non-recursive and therefore cheap.
