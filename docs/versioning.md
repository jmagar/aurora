# Versioning and reproducible consumption

Aurora has two deliberately different registry URL contracts.

## Mutable discovery URLs

Use `https://aurora.tootie.tv/r/<name>.json` while browsing and prototyping.
These names follow the deployed `main` revision. They are cached briefly
(`max-age=300`, `stale-while-revalidate=86400`) and can change after a release.
Next.js content-hashed `/_next/static/*` assets retain the framework's one-year
immutable cache policy; CI verifies that policy and that browser source maps are
absent. They are not registry install URLs.

## Immutable production URLs

Production consumers pin the full 40-character Git commit that they reviewed:

```bash
AURORA_SHA=<full-40-character-commit>
npx shadcn@latest add \
  "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jmagar/aurora/${AURORA_SHA}/public/r/aurora-base.json"
```

The commit URL is content-addressed by Git. Record the SHA in the consuming
repository beside the vendored component update. Do not use a branch name or
`latest` in reproducible builds. Release tags are human-friendly aliases; the
full commit remains the authoritative pin.

Container deployments use the same rule at the image layer: deploy
`ghcr.io/jmagar/aurora@sha256:<digest>`, then verify that the served
`X-Aurora-Revision` equals the CI-tested source SHA. The publish workflow stores
the image reference, source SHA, and SPDX SBOM together as run artifacts.

## Upgrade procedure

1. Read the `Unreleased` and versioned migration notes in `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. Select and review a full Aurora commit.
3. Install from the immutable raw GitHub URL.
4. Review the vendored diff; do not overwrite downstream changes blindly.
5. Run the consumer's type, build, accessibility, dark/light, and visual gates.
6. Commit the Aurora SHA with the generated component changes.
