# Session: Android Chat — Code Review, Live Test, 14 Polish Beads, Multi-Wave Implementation

## User Request

After the parallel-dispatch session that landed PRs #6–#15: ask for an auth/server briefing, run a code review on the full diff, address all findings, install the APK via emulator on dookie and walk the chat flow end-to-end via claude-in-mobile / ADB, file all UI polish opportunities as beads, run lavra-research on each, and then lavra-work the resulting backlog.

## Session Overview

Long-running execution session. Three distinct phases:

1. **Code review + fixes**: 6 review findings addressed (AuthRepository, ChatViewModel handshake gate, SidebarViewModel timeout, ChatScreen empty-image guard, CodexRepository demux logging, dead `session/update` regression). Build green, APK uploaded.
2. **Live emulator test + bead capture**: Installed APK on dookie's existing emulator, drove the chat flow via ADB. Discovered `getAuthStatus` is not a real Codex protocol method — patched StartupViewModel to trust local AUTH_METHOD. Sent a real prompt round-trip ("Say hello and count from 1 to 3" → "Hello. 1, 2, 3." + tool call). Catalogued 14 polish opportunities as beads, dispatched 4 parallel lavra-research agents to attach evidence to each.
3. **Multi-wave lavra-work execution**: Three waves of parallel-then-sequential agent dispatch. Wave 1 (q007, bcjw, thfe) shipped via the user committing `5bea020 Polish Android chat components`. Wave 2 (vyjr, mkr1, syc7, w0am) shipped via three commits. Wave 3 (ilkm, xe0i, 01xq, nev6, 6mwo) all touched `ChatScreen.kt` so a single sequential agent owned the file; shipped via `830e323`. All 12 polish beads closed; APK uploaded after each wave.

## Sequence of Events

1. Asked about auth model + server target; identified `codex app-server --listen ws://127.0.0.1:4500` on dookie (loopback, no auth required)
2. Ran code-review skill with 3 finder angles + verifier; 6 findings consolidated
3. Applied fixes; rebased through a large remote update that had independently fixed 2 of the same issues; resolved 4 conflict files keeping both the remote refactor and the timeout-safety additions
4. Built APK 21M, uploaded to `gdrive:Aurora/app-debug.apk`
5. Installed APK on dookie's emulator-5554 via ADB; launched and observed LoginScreen
6. Identified `getAuthStatus` is not in Codex protocol — patched StartupViewModel to trust local `AUTH_METHOD`
7. Bypassed login, observed chat screen, sent real message; round-trip worked; tool call rendered
8. Tested ApprovalPolicyBar dropdown (worked), model selector dropdown (didn't open — bug), attach button, sidebar (opened by accident)
9. Filed 14 polish beads via 4 parallel `bd create` batches
10. Dispatched 4 parallel `lavra-research` agents to attach RESEARCH comments to each bead
11. Committed and pushed StartupViewModel fix
12. Ran cleanup (worktrees, branches, stashes, stale remote refs)
13. **Wave 1** dispatched: q007, bcjw, thfe (3 parallel agents)
14. User committed all wave-1 changes as `5bea020 Polish Android chat components`
15. **Wave 2** dispatched: vyjr alone + mkr1+syc7 combined + w0am (3 parallel agents)
16. Committed per-bead, pushed, APK uploaded
17. **Wave 3** dispatched: 5 beads sequentially via 1 mega-agent with ChatScreen.kt ownership
18. Combined build green; commit + push + APK upload
19. lavra-learn over today's beads — 1 net-new KB entry (hook deduplicates aggressively)

## Key Findings

- **`getAuthStatus` is not a Codex app-server protocol method** (`StartupViewModel.kt:85`). The OpenAI docs at developers.openai.com/codex/app-server list no such RPC. Calling it produced no response; predicate hung indefinitely. Filed as `aurora-design-system-rpia` (auto-closed when StartupViewModel was patched to trust local AUTH_METHOD).
- **`StartupViewModel` creates its own CodexClient** (`StartupViewModel.kt:68`), bypassing the `CodexRepository` singleton — dual-WebSocket regression of PR #10's fix. Filed as `aurora-design-system-7hqp`.
- **Model selector dropdown silently no-ops on tap** (`ModelReasoningBar.kt:84`) — `Modifier.clickable(enabled = models.isNotEmpty())` blocks the click handler while models are loading. The dropdown anchor is unresponsive until the async `model/list` response arrives. Fixed in wave 1.
- **Codex loopback listener is unauthenticated by default**: per the protocol docs, "Non-loopback WebSocket listeners currently allow unauthenticated connections by default during rollout" and "Local listeners such as `ws://127.0.0.1:PORT` are appropriate for localhost". Justifies the `AUTH_METHOD="none"` skip-auth path filed as `aurora-design-system-mkr1`.
- **`gh pr merge --delete-branch` only deletes the PR's registered head branch**; worktree-based branches with different names need manual deletion via `gh api -X DELETE repos/.../git/refs/heads/<branch>`.
- **`HapticFeedbackType.Reject` is not in the stable Compose UI API** (1.6.x baseline). Resolved via reflection with `LongPress` fallback (`AuroraPromptInput.kt`).
- **Codex localhost server rejects requests with an `Origin` header** with `403 Forbidden`. Python `websocket-client` adds it by default; OkHttp does not, so the Android client works as-is without intervention.

## Technical Decisions

- **Trust local `AUTH_METHOD` for startup auth check** instead of probing the server with `getAuthStatus`. Server probe is unreliable (not a real protocol method) and the local check is sufficient: if a credential was stored, route to Chat; otherwise route to Login.
- **`AUTH_METHOD="none"` for unauthenticated localhost servers**. `AppSettings.isAuthenticated` already treats any non-null AUTH_METHOD as authenticated. `StartupViewModel.localAuthStatus` maps `"none" → AuthStatus.ApiKey` so the splash routes straight to Chat.
- **Approval bar moved to TopAppBar IconButton + ModalBottomSheet** rather than auto-hide-on-scroll. Material 3 conventions, simpler implementation, no scroll-handling complexity.
- **Single sequential agent for wave 3** (5 beads all touching ChatScreen.kt). Parallel dispatch would race-overwrite; mega-agent with full ChatScreen.kt ownership shipped all 5 in one combined commit.
- **Avatars auto-resolve from role string** (`AuroraAvatar.kt`): "You"/"User" → `Icons.Default.Person` in cyan, "Assistant"/"System" → `Icons.Default.AutoAwesome` in violet. Keeps the existing `AuroraMessage` callsites unchanged.
- **Server URL on LoginScreen persisted with debounced 500ms write** rather than save-on-blur — matches the existing SettingsScreen pattern.

**Closed earlier in session (code-review wave):** 7 P1 review-thread beads from prior PR #5–#15 work (ped2, 7q35, 9iap, fosp, tz5p, 7t9j, 359c).

**Knowledge comments added:** 7 structured LEARNED/PATTERN/FACT entries via `bd comments add` on q007, vyjr, 01xq, mkr1, thfe, 6mwo. Memory-capture hook promoted 1 to `.lavra/memory/knowledge.jsonl` (`learned-compose-clickable-enabled-on-empty-data-blocks-tap-feedback`); other 6 deduplicated against existing entries.

**Remaining open (out of scope for this session):** 50 total. Mix of PR #17 review beads, swarm beads for the `wquo` PR#5-port epic, and other unrelated features.

## Repository Maintenance

| Action | Evidence | Outcome |
|--------|----------|---------|
| `docs/plans/` cleanup | `ls docs/plans/` returned no files | No-op — directory empty |
| `docs/superpowers/plans/complete/` exists | `ls docs/superpowers/plans/complete/` returned valid dir | No moves: the 7 plan files in `docs/superpowers/plans/` correspond to other workstreams (color-token-expansion, registry-taxonomy, kotlin-phase1/2/3, pr5-followups, pr5-port). None correspond to today's 14 polish beads, which went research→implementation with no plan files. |
| Worktree audit | `git worktree list` shows main + `.worktrees/codex-android-pr5-followups` (HEAD 3e37f0d on `fix/codex-android-pr5-followups`) | Worktree NOT removed: branch has 1 unique commit (session log) and tracks `origin/fix/codex-android-pr5-followups`. Separate work stream, not safe to remove. |
| Stale local branches | `git branch` shows main + `fix/codex-android-pr5-followups` only | No stale branches to clean (a previous cleanup session pruned all merged feature branches). |
| Remote branch audit | `git branch -r` shows main + `fix/codex-android-pr5-followups` | Clean. |
| `bd dolt push` | Push complete (with auto-export git-add warning, harmless) | Beads state synced to Dolt remote |
| Stale docs | Pre-existing session logs are append-only by design; no contradictions surfaced this session | No-op |

## Tools and Skills Used

- **Bash**: `bd`, `git`, `gh`, `rtk` wrappers, `./gradlew`, `adb`, `ssh dookie`, `rclone`, `python3` snippets — for nearly every coordination step
- **Read/Write/Edit**: file inspection and direct edits when not delegated to subagents
- **Agent (general-purpose subagents)**: dispatched 5 planning agents + 5 execution agents (prior session continuation) + 4 lavra-research agents + 3 wave-1 implementers + 3 wave-2 implementers + 1 wave-3 sequential implementer. ~15 subagent invocations total. Inter-agent WIP races observed during parallel waves — combined build is source of truth.
- **AskUserQuestion**: server-context confirmation, wave scope selection
- **Skill tool**: `code-review`, `gh-pr`, `screenshots`, `save-to-md`, `vibin:save-to-md`, `lavra:lavra-learn`, `lavra:lavra-work`, `lavra:lavra-work-multi`, `superpowers:dispatching-parallel-agents`
- **MCP tools**: `mcp__plugin_lab_lab__scout` (tool discovery), `mcp__plugin_lab_lab__invoke` (axon scrape of OpenAI Codex app-server docs)
- **ADB over SSH to dookie**: `adb install -r`, `adb shell input tap/text/keyevent`, `adb shell screencap -p`, `adb shell uiautomator dump`, `adb shell run-as` for DataStore prefs inspection, `adb logcat` for diagnostics
- **rclone**: `rclone copy` to gdrive:Aurora (5+ APK uploads, ~21M each)
- **Issues**: (a) `device` MCP tool name collision between `lab` and `claude-in-mobile` gateways — couldn't route to claude-in-mobile, fell back to direct ADB which worked fine. (b) Raw websocket-client Python rejected with 403 due to Origin header; switched to socket-level handshake without Origin. (c) `bd auto-export` git-add failures (harmless warnings, didn't block push).

```

## Errors Encountered

- **Rebase conflicts after large remote update**: while addressing review findings, a remote push landed with major refactors (MCP servers panel, goal management, RequestKind String migration). Resolved 4 conflict files manually keeping both the remote refactor (more comprehensive) and the timeout-safety additions (my unique contribution).
- **Build "errors" during parallel agent dispatch**: each parallel agent saw a different inconsistent WIP state of files being modified by sibling agents. Combined build at the end of the wave was green. Captured this as a LEARNED entry.
- **DataStore bypass attempt for login**: after discovering `getAuthStatus` hangs, attempted to bypass login by writing `AUTH_METHOD=apiKey` directly to the protobuf-encoded prefs file via `adb shell run-as`. The DataStore values were already persisted from the prior login attempt, but `isAuthenticated` was still false because the server-side check kept rejecting. Resolved by patching `StartupViewModel.doStartup` to trust local state.
- **`websocket-client` Python library 403 on direct codex server query**: rejected with `403 Forbidden` because of automatic Origin header. Switched to raw socket handshake without the Origin header.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| Area | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| Startup auth | Probed server with non-existent `getAuthStatus` → hung indefinitely | Trusts local `AUTH_METHOD`; routes directly |
| Logout | Cleared only `AUTH_TOKEN`, left `AUTH_METHOD` → marked authenticated on next start | Clears all auth keys via `clearAuth()` |
| LoginScreen | No server URL field; user had to log in once before finding settings | Server URL field at top with Uri keyboard + Skip-for-localhost button |
| ChatScreen empty | Blank black area | Welcome state with 5 cyan tappable starter prompts |
| Model selector | Silent no-op until models loaded | Always opens; shows "Loading models…" placeholder if empty |
| Approval bar | Fixed 56dp band below model selector | Shield IconButton in TopAppBar opens ModalBottomSheet |
| Approval dropdown | Bare label list, no current-selection indicator | Two-line items with description + violet accent + checkmark |
| Sidebar empty state | Rose "Start one" button + floating settings gear | Cyan AuroraButton + pinned footer with auth-method label |
| Sidebar footer | Floated to wherever the LazyColumn ended | Pinned to drawer bottom regardless of session count |
| Avatars | Single colored letter (Y / A) | Person icon (cyan) for user, AutoAwesome (violet) for assistant |
| TopAppBar | "Connected" / "Thinking..." text only | Thread name + cwd basename two-line title; status as colored dot on right |
| Haptics | None | LongPress on send/attach, TextHandleMove on @mention, Reject (or LongPress fallback) on send-while-thinking |
| Tool call cards | Already expandable (verified pre-existing in 5bea020) | No change |

## Verification Evidence

| Command | Expected | Actual | Status |
|---------|----------|--------|--------|
| `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` after wave 1 | BUILD SUCCESSFUL | BUILD SUCCESSFUL (55 tasks) | ✓ |
| `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` after wave 2 | BUILD SUCCESSFUL | BUILD SUCCESSFUL | ✓ |
| `./gradlew :app:assembleDebug` after wave 3 | BUILD SUCCESSFUL | BUILD SUCCESSFUL (combined diff) | ✓ |
| `adb install -r aurora-app-debug.apk` | Success | Success | ✓ |
| Live chat round-trip via emulator | Streaming reply with tool call | "Hello. 1, 2, 3." + `Using \`beads\`` chip | ✓ |
| `git push` per wave | up-to-date | 3 pushes succeeded | ✓ |
| `bd dolt push` | Push complete | Push complete (×N) | ✓ (with harmless auto-export warning) |
| `rclone copy` to gdrive | 100% upload | 100% × 5+ uploads at 6–10 MiB/s | ✓ |

## Risks and Rollback

- **`AUTH_METHOD="none"` and StartupViewModel local-trust changes**: relaxes auth gating. For a localhost development server this is correct; if a production server later requires server-side auth verification, this code will need to re-add a real probe (filed as research note on `mkr1`). Rollback: revert `230e323` and `890ea07`.
- **Parallel agent dispatch with file-scope ownership**: relies on agents honoring the ownership rule. Wave 1 had no overlap, wave 2 had natural pairing, wave 3 used a single sequential agent. If a future wave dispatches 2 parallel agents touching the same file, the last writer wins. Mitigation: combined build catches structural issues; file-scope-by-name in agent prompts is the only enforcement.

## Decisions Not Taken

- **Codex hexagon brand glyph for avatar**: no asset exists; substituted `Icons.Default.AutoAwesome` (sparkles) in violet. Filed as a TODO in xe0i wave but no follow-up bead.
- **AuroraChip primitive for welcome-state suggestions**: used Material 3 `AssistChip` inline for now. A future bead to centralize an `AuroraSuggestionChip` would be reasonable.
- **Inline rename for thread name**: `nev6` ships the display change; rename requires a `repo.renameThread(threadId, name)` plumbing pass that would touch `CodexRepository.kt` (outside wave-3 file scope). Filed in agent's TODO note.
- **Exit code / stderr split for tool call cards**: would require `ToolCall` model + protocol parsing changes; out of scope for `6mwo` (which was already largely no-op).

## References

- Codex app-server protocol: https://developers.openai.com/codex/app-server (scraped via Axon)
- PRs merged earlier in session continuation: #6, #7, #8, #9, #10, #11, #12, #13, #14, #15
- Beads created today: rpia, 7hqp, thfe, mkr1, syc7, w0am, 6mwo, bcjw, xe0i, ilkm, q007, vyjr, nev6, 01xq

## Open Questions

- **Codex thread name update wire path**: `nev6` agent added handling for `thread/name/updated` notification but the docs don't show clients triggering a rename. Need to research the rename RPC if inline-rename is a follow-up.
- **`HapticFeedbackType.Reject` API stability**: reflection guard added — when does Compose UI ≥1.7 land in the Aurora build?
- **`worktree-aurora-design-system-ul5` historical**: cleaned up in prior session, never reappeared. Was it ever real work or just an orphaned worktree? Out of scope.

## Next Steps

**Unfinished from this session:**
- None — all 12 polish beads closed, all 3 waves shipped, APK on gdrive.

**Follow-on tasks (not yet started):**
- Cleanup of `.worktrees/codex-android-pr5-followups` if the corresponding PR has been merged (left intact this session)
- File a bead for AuroraChip / AuroraSuggestionChip primitive (welcome state currently uses M3 AssistChip inline)
- Codex hexagon vector drawable (avatar uses AutoAwesome placeholder)
- Inline thread-rename via `repo.renameThread()` RPC (TopAppBar shows name but no edit affordance)

**Recommended immediate next commands:**
```bash
# Install the final APK on the emulator for visual verification
ssh dookie "adb install -r /tmp/aurora-app-debug.apk && adb shell am start -n tv.tootie.aurora.app/.MainActivity"
# View remaining open beads to plan next session
bd ready --json | jq '.[].title' | head -10
```
