# Aurora Neon Zed theme + dotfiles modernization

> Note on scope: this session began in `~/` (home/dotfiles context) and ended in
> the `aurora-design-system` repo. The repo-local deliverable is the **Aurora
> Neon** Zed editor theme + icon theme under `editors/zed/`. Earlier phases
> (mise review, zsh4humans→antidote migration, chezmoi tracking) touched the home
> dir and the separate `~/.local/share/chezmoi` dotfiles repo, not this repo;
> they are summarized for completeness but produced no commits here.

## 1. User Request

A sequence of asks: review my mise setup; replace zsh4humans with something
actively developed and fast; review/expand chezmoi tracking; "how do I create
zed themes?" → build an Aurora Zed theme, make it brighter/pop, add a full
file-type icon set, place it in `aurora-design-system`, then rename it so it
doesn't collide with canonical Aurora.

## 2. Session Overview

- Reviewed mise config (flagged no-lockfile, orphaned `pnpm`, brew/mise tool duplication); user applied fixes.
- Migrated the interactive shell from **zsh4humans → antidote** (static-bundle mode), preserving p10k, plugins, fzf keybindings, completions; removed dead per-startup env lines. (home dir; dotfiles repo commit `55931a4`.)
- Expanded **chezmoi** tracking: added `statusline-aurora.sh`, encrypted `settings.json`/`settings.local.json`, codex `.credentials.json`, and gemini `settings.json`/`mcp.json`/`gemini-credentials.json`/`google_accounts.json`; removed stale gmail/proton auth; hardened perms to 0600.
- Built the **Aurora Zed theme** (dark+light, schema v0.2.0), iterated brightness twice to a neon palette, then added a **full file-type icon theme** (60 generated glyph-tile SVGs, 98 suffix + 22 stem mappings).
- Placed the work in this repo under `editors/zed/` + served copy `public/zed/`; deployed to dookie and steamy.
- Audited palette drift across all 11 Aurora theme artifacts: only Zed diverged. Per user decision (Zed-only neon), renamed Zed to **Aurora Neon** and pushed (`dfae0cf`).

## 3. Sequence of Events

1. mise review → identified lockfile/orphan/brew-dup issues; user fixed; advised on `idiomatic_version_file` and settings.
2. zsh4humans → antidote migration: baseline benchmark, install antidote, rewrite `.zshrc`/`.zshenv`, re-implement compinit + fzf keys, verify under pty.
3. chezmoi audit across `~/.claude`, `~/.codex`, `~/.gemini`; encrypt+track secrets, remove auth files, harden perms; commit+push dotfiles repo.
4. Zed theme created (`editors/zed/themes/aurora.json`), schema-validated, deployed to `~/.config/zed` + steamy.
5. Two brightening passes (shimmer → neon); canvas lifted `#07131c`→`#102a3e`, syntax pushed to electric cyan/violet/mint/gold/rose.
6. Full icon theme generated via `generate-icons.py`; schema-validated; extension deployed to steamy.
7. Committed editor-themes collection (`0e34218`), pushed `feat/zed-aurora-theme`.
8. Palette-drift audit → only Zed neon; everything else canonical.
9. Renamed Zed → "Aurora Neon"; cleared a stale `index.lock` left by a concurrent agent; committed `dfae0cf`; verified across origin + all deploy targets.

## 4. Key Findings

- Zed UI themes can be dropped into `~/.config/zed/themes/`, but **icon themes only load from an installed extension** — drove the `editors/zed/` extension layout.
- Palette-drift audit: of 11 Aurora theme artifacts, only `editors/zed/themes/aurora.json` carried the neon palette; `registry/aurora/styles/aurora.css` and all `editors/*` + `shell/*` remained canonical `#07131c`/`#29b6f6`. The "drift" was a single deliberate divergence.
- A **concurrent agent** is actively committing to `feat/zed-aurora-theme` (`1eeac58`, `18ac845`, `446e762` — claude-code/warp), disjoint from the Zed work; its crashed commit left a stale `.git/index.lock` (36 min old) that blocked this session's commit.
- `editors/` is a cohesive editor-themes collection (`zed`, `warp`, `claude-code`); `aurora-design-system/CLAUDE.md` was updated (by user) to document `editors/` + `shell/` as excluded from the Next/TS/eslint build.

## 5. Technical Decisions

- **antidote over zinit/sheldon**: fastest cold start (static bundle), cleanest maintenance; honest finding that the plugin manager was never the startup bottleneck (host load dominates).
- **Aurora glyph tiles over recolored brand logos** for icons: cohesive, license-clean, self-contained; generated from category-tinted tables for full coverage.
- **Zed-only neon** (not a full-brand rebrand): kept canonical `aurora.css`/registry/Android untouched; renamed the Zed theme **Aurora Neon** so it reads as a distinct entry rather than colliding with canonical "Aurora".
- **Served copies** under `public/{zed,warp}/` follow the repo's `public/r/` registry-serving convention.

## 6. Files Changed (this repo)

| status | path | previous path | purpose | evidence |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| created | `editors/zed/themes/aurora.json` | — | UI themes (Aurora Neon / Light), schema v0.2.0, 128 style keys | `check-jsonschema ok` |
| created | `editors/zed/icon_themes/aurora.json` | — | Icon themes (Aurora Neon Icons / Light) | `check-jsonschema ok` |
| created | `editors/zed/icons/*.svg` (60) | — | Glyph-tile + folder/chevron SVGs | `60 svgs, all paths resolve` |
| created | `editors/zed/generate-icons.py` | — | Reproducible icon + icon-theme generator | re-run regenerates |
| created | `editors/zed/extension.toml` | — | Extension manifest (`id=aurora-neon`) | committed `dfae0cf` |
| created | `editors/zed/README.md` | — | Install/usage/publish docs | committed |
| created | `public/zed/aurora.json` | — | Served copy of UI theme | byte-match w/ source |
| created | `editors/warp/*`, `editors/claude-code/*`, `public/warp/*` | — | Sibling editor themes (committed in `0e34218` scope) | `git show 0e34218 --stat` |

Cross-repo / cross-host (not this repo): `~/.zshrc`, `~/.zshenv` (antidote migration); `~/.local/share/chezmoi` commit `55931a4` (zsh + tracking + encrypted secrets); `~/.config/zed/themes/aurora.json` (dookie deploy); `C:\Users\jmaga\zed-aurora-extension\*` (steamy deploy).

## 7. Beads Activity

**No bead activity.** No beads were created, claimed, closed, or commented during this session. The session's repo work (editor themes) was done ad-hoc and not tracked in `bd`. `bd ready` shows only unrelated Android/Codex P1 issues (e.g. `aurora-design-system-ikzo`, `-wquo` epic) — out of scope here. See Next Steps for a suggested follow-up bead.

## 8. Repository Maintenance

- **Plans**: no `docs/plans/` directory exists → nothing to move. No-op (evidence: `find docs/plans` returned no dir).
- **Beads**: read `bd ready`; no session-relevant beads found; created none (ad-hoc work). Transparent no-op rather than inventing tracker state.
- **Worktrees/branches**: single clean worktree (`git worktree list`); `feat/zed-aurora-theme` and `feat/prompt-input-action-left` both **not** ancestors of `origin/main` (live) → left untouched, no deletions.
- **Stale docs**: `editors/zed/README.md` updated to the Aurora Neon names this session; `aurora-design-system/CLAUDE.md` was updated (by user) to document `editors/`+`shell/`. No further stale docs identified.
- **Lock cleanup**: removed a 36-min-stale `.git/index.lock` after confirming no live git process (evidence: mtime `23:09` vs `23:45`, no `git commit/add/merge` process).

## 9. Tools and Skills Used

- **Shell (Bash)**: git, rsync, ssh (steamy-wsl), `chezmoi`, `mise`, `hyperfine`, `uvx check-jsonschema`, `jq`, `python3`. Purpose: migration, validation, deployment, benchmarking.
- **File tools**: Read/Write/Edit for `.zshrc`/`.zshenv`, theme JSON, generator, README, extension.toml.
- **External CLI**: `axon` (RAG `search`+`ask`) to answer "how to create Zed themes" with cited sources.
- **AskUserQuestion**: framework choice (antidote), icon style (glyph tiles), commit scope, propagation scope.
- **Issues encountered**: `urllib` 403 on the Zed schema (fixed with a UA via curl); a stale `index.lock` from a concurrent agent (removed after staleness check); `git pull --rebase` refused due to unrelated unstaged files (benign — push was a clean fast-forward).

## 10. Commands Executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `git checkout -b feat/zed-aurora-theme origin/main` | clean branch, untracked theme files carried over |
| `python3 editors/zed/generate-icons.py` | 60 svgs, 98 suffixes, 22 stems |
| `uvx check-jsonschema --schemafile .../v0.2.0.json editors/zed/themes/aurora.json` | `ok -- validation done` |
| `git commit … && git push origin feat/zed-aurora-theme` (`0e34218`, `dfae0cf`) | pushed; branch in sync with origin |
| `rsync -rtq --delete … steamy-wsl:/mnt/c/Users/jmaga/zed-aurora-extension/` | extension synced to steamy |

## 11. Errors Encountered

- **Zed schema fetch 403** (urllib, no UA) → refetched with `curl -A "Mozilla/5.0"`; diff completed.
- **`.git/index.lock` exists** (concurrent agent's crashed commit) → blocked `git add`/`commit`; verified 36-min stale + no live git process, removed lock, re-committed (`dfae0cf`).
- **`git pull --rebase` refused** ("unstaged changes") → benign; push was a fast-forward and succeeded; unrelated dirty files left untouched.

## 12. Behavior Changes (Before/After)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Zed themes | none in repo | Aurora Neon / Aurora Neon Light + Aurora Neon Icons available via extension |
| Zed theme palette | n/a | neon (canvas `#102a3e`, cyan `#38d2ff`) — divergent from canonical Aurora, intentionally |
| Theme distribution | n/a | served at `aurora.tootie.tv/zed/aurora.json`; extension deployed to dookie + steamy |

## 13. Verification Evidence

| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `check-jsonschema … themes/aurora.json` | valid | `ok -- validation done` | pass |
| `check-jsonschema … icon_themes/aurora.json` | valid | `ok -- validation done` | pass |
| hex scan of theme JSON | no malformed hex | caught + fixed `#1b3span`, `#688persp` | pass |
| origin + 4 deploy targets carry "Aurora Neon" | all match | origin/public/dookie/steamy all "Aurora Neon" | pass |
| icon path resolution | all 60 exist | `missing icon files: none` | pass |

## 14. Risks and Rollback

- **Theme rename breaks current selection**: Zed `settings.json` referencing old "Aurora" won't resolve → re-select Aurora Neon. Low risk, user-visible only.
- **Shared branch with a concurrent agent**: `feat/zed-aurora-theme` carries both this Zed work and another agent's claude-code/warp commits. Rollback for the Zed rename: `git revert dfae0cf`. To isolate: cherry-pick `dfae0cf` (+`0e34218`) onto a fresh branch.

## 15. Decisions Not Taken

- **Full Aurora rebrand to neon** — rejected; would cascade to `aurora.css`, registry, Android, website. Kept neon Zed-only.
- **Recolored brand-logo icon set** — rejected for cohesion/licensing; chose generated glyph tiles.
- **mise lockfile** — user explicitly declined.

## 16. References

- Zed theme schema `https://zed.dev/schema/themes/v0.2.0.json`; icon theme schema `https://zed.dev/schema/icon_themes/v0.2.0.json`
- Zed docs (via axon): `https://zed.dev/docs/themes`, `https://zed.dev/docs/extensions/themes`
- Dependabot alert (pre-existing, unrelated): `https://github.com/jmagar/aurora-design-system/security/dependabot/49`

## 17. Open Questions

- Should `feat/zed-aurora-theme` (Zed + concurrent agent's claude-code/warp) be split into separate PRs, or shipped together?
- Is the neon Zed palette final, or is another brightness/saturation pass wanted?

## 18. Next Steps

1. **Activate in Zed** (each machine): `zed: install dev extension` → the extension folder (dookie `editors/zed`, steamy `C:\Users\jmaga\zed-aurora-extension`); then `theme selector` → **Aurora Neon**, `icon theme selector` → **Aurora Neon Icons**. Remove the `~/.config/zed/themes/aurora.json` drop-in to avoid a duplicate.
2. **Open the PR** for `feat/zed-aurora-theme` (or split out the Zed commits). Suggested follow-up bead: "Open PR: Aurora Neon Zed editor + icon theme".
3. **Decide** on the shared-branch question (Open Questions) before merge.
4. The `feat/prompt-input-action-left` branch remains live and independent — unaffected by this session.
