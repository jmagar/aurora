# Homelab MOTD dashboard, Aurora theme merge, and dependency security fix

## User Request
Started with "ssh dookie … Can we make it show useful info in the motd", then iterated:
add Docker info, make it adhere to Aurora design tokens, suppress the Ubuntu ESM
nag, track it all with chezmoi, then `/vibin:quick-push` + "merge back into main",
delete the merged branch, and fix the flagged Dependabot advisory.

## Session Overview
Three threads of work in one session:
1. Built a homelab MOTD dashboard for `dookie` (`/etc/update-motd.d/20-homelab-dashboard`),
   colored with exact Aurora dark tokens as 24-bit truecolor, and silenced Ubuntu's
   ESM/Pro advertising. Captured the whole system change in the chezmoi dotfiles repo
   as an idempotent `run_onchange_` script.
2. In `aurora-design-system`: merged `feat/zed-aurora-theme` (9 commits, v0.2.0 editor/
   terminal themes) into `main` and deleted the branch.
3. Fixed Dependabot alert #49 (`tmp` path traversal) and discovered the root cause —
   pnpm 10 silently ignores `package.json`'s `pnpm` field, so the repo's security
   override block was dead. Migrated it to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.

## Sequence of Events
1. Probed `dookie` data sources (docker, nvidia-smi, zpool, tailscale, df, free); all readable without sudo, passwordless sudo confirmed.
2. Wrote `/etc/update-motd.d/20-homelab-dashboard`; disabled `10-help-text`, `50-motd-news`, `91-contract-ua-esm-status` and the `motd-news.timer`.
3. Added richer Docker info (image/volume counts, wrapped running-container list); hardened the tailscale status read (post-boot JSON-empty fallback).
4. Invoked the `vibin:aurora-design-system` skill; read exact dark token hex from `registry/aurora/styles/aurora.css`; remapped all colors to Aurora tokens as truecolor; replaced the `⚠` emoji with a `●` glow-dot and sentence-cased `ONLINE`→`Online`.
5. Killed the ESM nag at the source: disabled `90-updates-available`, masked `apt-news`/`esm-cache`, set `pro apt_news=false`, and added a clean `pkg` line via `apt-check` (real applicable counts only).
6. Captured everything in chezmoi as `run_onchange_after_60-motd.sh` (dashboard embedded in a quoted heredoc); committed `e8e5873` to the dotfiles repo.
7. `/vibin:quick-push` auto-detected `aurora-design-system` (cwd had drifted there); tree was clean → no-op. Interpreted "merge back into main" as merging `feat/zed-aurora-theme`.
8. Verified clean fast-forward base, did a `--no-ff` merge (`71abb9f`) matching repo convention, pushed `main`. Deleted `feat/zed-aurora-theme` local + remote.
9. Investigated Dependabot alert #49 → `tmp@0.2.5` < 0.2.6; found the `pnpm.overrides` block was being ignored by pnpm 10.
10. Migrated overrides + `onlyBuiltDependencies` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml`, added `tmp@<0.2.6: 0.2.6`, removed the dead `pnpm` field; `pnpm install` clean, lint + build pass; committed `7aa883e` and pushed `main`.

## Key Findings
- **pnpm 10 ignores the `package.json` `pnpm` field** — `pnpm install` prints `WARN The "pnpm" field in package.json is no longer read`. The repo's dependabot-remediation pins (minimatch, postcss, qs, brace-expansion, ajv, …) were therefore inactive, which let `tmp@0.2.5` (GHSA-ph9p-34f9-6g65, high) slip in. Settings home is now `pnpm-workspace.yaml` (https://pnpm.io/settings).
- **Lockfile churn was minimal** — only `tmp` actually moved (the other pins already matched the lockfile's resolved versions); the migration mainly future-proofs them.
- `tmp` is a transitive **dev** dependency: `patch-package@8.0.1` → `style-dictionary@4.0.0` (via `@bundled-es-modules/glob`).
- chezmoi here is home-dotfiles only (no `.chezmoiroot`); system files in `/etc` are best managed via a `run_onchange_` script, not direct tracking.
- `docker stats` adds ~2s/login → omitted from the dashboard; `docker ps`/`system df` are instant.

## Technical Decisions
- **Truecolor, not 256-color** for the MOTD — lets the dashboard use Aurora's exact token hex rather than approximating.
- **`run_onchange_` script over direct file tracking** — chezmoi targets `$HOME`; a self-contained, idempotent provisioning script is the idiomatic way to manage root-owned `/etc` files and re-runs on edit.
- **`--no-ff` merge** for the theme branch — matches the repo's existing merge-commit convention (`Merge pull request #1 …`).
- **Full overrides migration** (not just a `tmp`-only entry) — fixing `tmp` properly requires the working settings location; migrating the whole block re-activates every pin in one authoritative place.
- **`apt-check` for the `pkg` line** — reports only actually-applicable updates, excluding paywalled ESM-only counts.

## Beads Activity
| id | title | action | status | why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| aurora-design-system-bsam | Verify Dependabot alert #49 (tmp) auto-closes on main | created (P3) | open | Track GitHub auto-close + cross-repo pnpm override audit |

## Repository Maintenance
- **Plans**: no `docs/plans/` directory exists → nothing to move. Evidence: `ls docs/plans/` → "(no docs/plans dir)".
- **Beads**: `bd ready` showed 10 open P1 issues, all Android Codex PR#5/#17 reviews — none relevant to this session. Created one P3 follow-up (`-bsam`). `bd` auto-export printed a non-blocking `git add failed: exit status 128` warning; the issue persisted in the dolt DB regardless.
- **Worktrees/branches**: deleted `feat/zed-aurora-theme` (merged into `main`, safe `-d`). Left `feat/prompt-input-action-left` — `git branch --merged main` confirms it is NOT merged. Single worktree only.
- **Stale docs**: `CLAUDE.md` states `pnpm@10.33.2` (still accurate) but does not mention the overrides-location move; not contradicted, so left unchanged — noted as a follow-up rather than editing it here (would add an unrelated dirty file to this commit).
- **Transparency**: pre-existing untracked files (`docs/mockups/`, `public/themes-mockup-previews/`, `public/themes-mockup.html`) are not mine and were left untouched; the session commit is path-limited to this log only.

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Shell/file tools**: extensive Bash (system probing, git, pnpm, chezmoi, bd), Read/Write/Edit for the dashboard, run script, pnpm files, and memory.
- **Skills**: `vibin:aurora-design-system` (token source of truth), `vibin:quick-push` (no-op, clean tree), `vibin:save-to-md` (this log).
- **MCP**: attempted `context7 query-docs` for pnpm settings — failed (monthly quota exceeded); fell back to `WebFetch` of https://pnpm.io/settings, which confirmed the `pnpm-workspace.yaml` location.
- **External CLIs**: `gh api` (Dependabot alert detail), `bd` (beads), `chezmoi`, `pnpm`, `docker`, `nvidia-smi`, `zpool`, `tailscale`, `apt-check`.

## Commands Executed
| command | result |
|---|---|
| `gh api repos/jmagar/aurora-design-system/dependabot/alerts/49` | tmp < 0.2.6, high, GHSA-ph9p-34f9-6g65, patched 0.2.6 |
| `pnpm why tmp` | tmp@0.2.5 via patch-package → style-dictionary; "pnpm field ignored" WARN |
| `pnpm install` | `Packages: +1 -1`; tmp → 0.2.6; no ignored-field warning |
| `pnpm lint` | exit 0 |
| `pnpm build` | exit 0; 191+ routes generated |
| `git merge --no-ff feat/zed-aurora-theme` | merge commit 71abb9f |
| `git push origin main` (×2) | `71abb9f`, then `7aa883e` |

## Errors Encountered
- **context7 `query-docs`**: "Monthly quota exceeded" → resolved by fetching https://pnpm.io/settings directly with WebFetch.
- **`bd` auto-export**: `git add failed: exit status 128` warning on issue creation → non-blocking; issue stored in dolt DB.
- **Early tailscale status showed `?`**: post-boot daemon was briefly busy returning empty JSON `BackendState` → added an IP-present + `tailscale status` exit-code fallback.

## Behavior Changes (Before/After)
| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| dookie MOTD | Ubuntu default banner + ESM/Pro advertising | Aurora-tokenized dashboard (cpu/mem/disk/pkg/gpu/zfs/docker/net), no ESM nag |
| aurora `main` | at `ca4bd62`, no editor themes | editor/terminal themes v0.2.0 merged; tmp vuln fixed |
| pnpm overrides | dead in ignored `package.json` field | active in `pnpm-workspace.yaml` |

## Verification Evidence
| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `grep -oE "tmp@[0-9.]+" pnpm-lock.yaml` | tmp@0.2.6 | tmp@0.2.6 | pass |
| `pnpm install` (rerun) | no ignored-field warning | none | pass |
| `pnpm lint` | exit 0 | exit 0 | pass |
| `pnpm build` | exit 0 | exit 0, 191+ routes | pass |
| `git rev-list --left-right --count origin/main...main` | 0 0 | 0 0 | pass |

## Risks and Rollback
- Re-activating the override pins could in principle shift transitive versions, but observed lockfile churn was just the `tmp` bump; lint + build pass. Rollback: `git revert 7aa883e` and `pnpm install`.
- MOTD/system changes on dookie are reproducible from chezmoi `e8e5873`; ESM service masks reversible via `systemctl unmask` and re-enabling the disabled motd scripts.

## Decisions Not Taken
- A `tmp`-only override in a new `pnpm-workspace.yaml` while leaving the dead block in `package.json` — rejected; would split config across two locations and leave other pins inactive.
- Editing `CLAUDE.md` to document the overrides move — deferred to avoid bundling an unrelated change into the session-log commit.

## References
- https://pnpm.io/settings — pnpm 10 settings location (overrides → pnpm-workspace.yaml)
- https://github.com/jmagar/aurora-design-system/security/dependabot/49 — alert #49
- GHSA-ph9p-34f9-6g65 — tmp path traversal

## Next Steps
1. Confirm Dependabot alert #49 auto-closes after GitHub re-scans `main` (bead `-bsam`).
2. Sweep `~/workspace` pnpm-10 repos (ghbd, etc.) for a stale `pnpm.overrides` in `package.json` with no `pnpm-workspace.yaml` — same silent security-pin regression.
3. Optional: add a one-line note to `CLAUDE.md` that overrides live in `pnpm-workspace.yaml`.
4. Optional: roll the MOTD dashboard out to tootie/squirts/shart (the chezmoi `run_onchange` script is host-portable; GPU/ZFS blocks self-skip).
