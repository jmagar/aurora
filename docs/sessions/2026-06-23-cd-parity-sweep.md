# CD-parity component sweep

## User Request
Find the React components in the Claude Design (CD) "Aurora Design System" project, convert/reskin them so the registry + gallery match CD 1:1, then "finish ALL of our components" — first all AI Elements, then the whole catalog.

## Session Overview
Started with housekeeping (merged `fix/registry-namespaced-deps` to main; cleaned 5 stale worktrees + 6 branches). Then ran the main effort: reskin the entire Aurora component catalog to match the Claude Design source 1:1 while keeping the registry's shadcn architecture (Radix, cva, a11y). Delivered ~141 components across 5 commits, all gates green (tsc, eslint, registry:build, slug-consistency test). registry.json grew 129 → 153 items.

## Sequence of Events
1. Housekeeping: `/vibin:quick-push` (no-op, clean) → merged namespaced-deps to main (ff), pushed; `/vibin:repo-status` → removed 5 worktrees + 6 merged/superseded branches.
2. Investigated CD project `a9af47aa`: found ~140 vanilla components + `CONVERSION.md`/`RECONCILIATION.md`. Discovered the registry components were already *more* advanced than CD's vanilla ones → user clarified: keep registry architecture, reskin to CD visuals, drop violet.
3. Pilot (manual): Button, Card, Switch, Tabs, Dialog + `aurora.css` CD-token merge. Fixed a Card gradient seam (default tier was inverted). Verified live on aurora.tootie.tv (dev container is bind-mounted to the repo → HMR).
4. Built the conversion pipeline: contract (`scratchpad/aurora-conversion/CONTRACT.md`), staged CD dsCard sources + reference screenshots locally (subagents can't reach the design MCP), and a throttled Workflow (chunks of 6 to avoid rate limits).
5. AI Elements: 40 reskins + 10 net-new, workflow-driven, verified.
6. Components: 49 ui "ready" reskins, 14 block reskins, 5 ui no-demo (reskin + demo), 18 truly-new (create), all workflow-driven.
7. Wiring: gallery routes (AI_DEMOS/COMPONENT_DEMOS), `lib/slug-map.ts`, `app/gallery/nav-data.ts`, `registry.json` items for the 24 net-new; `pnpm registry:build`.
8. Quick-push: bumped version 0.2.1 → 0.3.0, wrote this session doc, pushed.

## Key Findings
- The registry components were already shadcn (Radix/cva) and often richer than CD's vanilla reconstructions — so the task was a **reskin to CD visuals**, not a wholesale replace.
- AI elements use a shared `core.tsx` + `ai-elements.tsx` barrel + `ai-element-page.tsx` factory; reskins were made self-contained per-slug files, leaving a known dual-definition divergence for a later reconciliation pass.
- `slugToRegistry` (`lib/slug-map.ts`) is explicit (no auto-derive); new components require slug-map + registry.json + nav entries to pass `tests/gallery-slug-consistency.test.ts`.
- Workflow rate limits came purely from concurrency (~16 agents at once); chunking to 6 eliminated them.

## Technical Decisions
- CD wins on visuals; registry wins on architecture. Drop `violet` (removed from the system; tertiary is now `--axon-orange`).
- Tailwind v4: tokens via `[var(--aurora-*)]` / injected `<style>`; CD's `--font-mono` aliased to the repo's JetBrains Mono.
- 0.x semver: large feature + breaking violet drop → minor bump (0.3.0), not 1.0.0.
- Per-component agents edit only their own two files (component + demo); shared-file wiring done sequentially by the orchestrator.

## Files Changed
~290 files (full list in the 5 commits below). Summary by category:

| created | `registry/aurora/ui/{chat-message,chat-sidebar,color-picker,component-card,copy-button,multi-select,operation-icon,progress-ring,range-slider,rating,segmented,spotlight,status-dot,stepper,tag-input}.tsx` | net-new extensions |

## Beads Activity
- `aurora-design-system-ybi2` (epic) — created: CD→shadcn conversion effort.
- `-jqpq` (pilot) — created + worked: 6 representative components, notes updated through reskin + demo rebuild.
- `-rqq5` (AI Elements batch) — created + **closed**: all 50 AI elements done, wired, verified.
- Follow-up beads created: violet purge (token layer + remaining consumers), Claude Design back-sync (`/design-sync`), AI core/barrel reconciliation.

## Repository Maintenance
- **Plans**: none under `docs/plans/` relevant; no moves.
- **Beads**: closed `-rqq5`; epic + follow-ups remain open (violet purge, back-sync, reconciliation) for tracked remaining work.
- **Worktrees/branches**: earlier in session removed 5 worktrees (`.worktrees/*`, `/tmp/aurora-pr-23`) + 6 branches (merged/superseded), verified via `git worktree list` + ancestry; only `main` + `feat/cd-parity-sweep` remain.
- **Stale docs**: `components/CONVERSION.md` (in CD project) notes a Tailwind-v3 `tailwind.config.ts` step that is stale for this v4 repo — followed the registry's arbitrary-value pattern instead; noted, not edited (lives in the CD project, not this repo).

## Tools and Skills Used
- **Shell/file tools**: extensive (git, pnpm, tsc, eslint, python helpers).
- **Workflow (multi-agent)**: 6 throttled runs (chunks of 6) for reskin/create waves; one early run hit a transient 529/rate-limit at 16-concurrency, fixed by chunking.
- **claude_design MCP**: `list_projects/list_files/read_file/render_preview` to pull CD sources + project-scoped serve token (reusable across paths).
- **webwright skill + Playwright (firefox)**: CD reference screenshots + live gallery spot-checks; firefox driver was flaky under load (known dookie gotcha) → ran at low concurrency, some refs captured from source instead.
- **save-to-md / quick-push skills**: this doc + version bump + push.

## Commands Executed
| command | result |
|---|---|
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | clean at each commit |
| `pnpm lint` | 0 errors (a few non-blocking warnings) |
| `pnpm registry:build` | ✔ Building registry (153 items) |
| `npx tsx --test tests/gallery-slug-consistency.test.ts` | 3 pass, 0 fail |

## Errors Encountered
- Workflow `args` arrived as a string (script saw 0 items) → embedded the work-list in the script instead.
- Transient API overload/rate-limit on a 34-agent run → re-ran failures + chunked to 6.
- Violet drop broke consumers (`lib/themes.ts`, `parity-demo.tsx`, a story) + `queue.tsx` setState-in-effect + `command`/`spotlight` setState-in-effect → all fixed.

## Verification Evidence
| command | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `npx tsc --noEmit` | exit 0 | exit 0 | pass |
| `pnpm lint` | exit 0 | exit 0 (15 warnings) | pass |
| `pnpm registry:build` | build ok | ✔ 153 items | pass |
| slug-consistency test | 3 pass | 3 pass / 0 fail | pass |
| `/gallery/<slug>` (sampled) | HTTP 200 + CD-matching render | 200, matched | pass |

## Risks and Rollback
- Breaking changes: `violet` removed; some component APIs widened/changed (Card `elevated`/tier, DatePicker `Date`, AI-element prop expansions). Rollback = revert the branch; not merged to main.
- AI-element dual-definition (standalone `<slug>.tsx` vs old `core.tsx`) is intentional, tracked for reconciliation.

## Next Steps
1. Open a PR for `feat/cd-parity-sweep` and review.
2. AI `core.tsx`/barrel reconciliation pass (repoint barrel to standalone files, prune old copies).
3. Clear the 15 lint warnings (unused vars in `component-card`; `combobox`/`slider`/`multi-select` aria attrs).
4. Visual diff the full set against CD refs (only a sample was eyeballed this session).
5. `/design-sync` token layer + new components back to the CD project.
