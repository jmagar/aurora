## User request

"Find Aurora.html in the aurora design system — we need to port the page over to our Next.js app." Followed through the session by: fix the Components view to match the CD live catalog, add prev/next arrows to the component viewer, replace the header dropdown with an on-page shadcn/Kotlin flavor switch, implement four follow-up suggestions (light-mode pass, ⌘K drawer integration, URL state, mobile nav), and fix four console errors reported from the live site.

## Session overview

Ported the remaining Claude Design (CD) `Aurora.html` page experience into the Next.js app (phases 1–2 had previously landed the PaletteWall and a text-only catalog). Landed: site-wide ⌘K command palette, `/components` live catalog (real gallery demos as lazy scaled previews, detail drawer with prev/next arrows and install lines, shadcn/Android·Compose flavor toggle driven by `docs/component-kotlin-map.md`), `/icons` and `/docs` views, header/nav parity, mobile hamburger nav, URL state (`?flavor`, `?q`, `?c`), a light-mode verification pass, a fix for a pre-existing `main` build break, and a fix for invalid `<button>` nesting that was causing hydration errors on the live site. All work merged to `origin/main` (fast-forward pushes) and verified live on `aurora.tootie.tv`.

## Sequence of events

1. Authorized DesignSync (`/design-login`), located `Aurora.html` in the Claude Design project "Aurora Design System" (projectId `a9af47aa-77b0-43ed-b4cd-5d52391528e5`), and pulled all 10 source files (`aurora-site/*.jsx`, `site.css`, `colors_and_type.css`).
2. Audited the existing app: phases 1–2 of the port already existed (commits `159a682`, `d99b22c`); built a delta list (⌘K palette, Icons/Docs views, header parity).
3. Phase 3 (`d86e79a`): generalized the registry `command-palette` block (sections/placeholder/filter props), extracted `lib/fuzzy.ts`, built `SiteCommandPalette`, `/icons` (`IconsView` — Lucide grid + `OperationIcon` grid), `/docs` (6 CD pages on real routes with sticky sub-nav), header Search button + nav entries, hero eyebrow + footer copy parity.
4. Hit a pre-existing `main` build break (commit `71be925` pointed `attachments.tsx` at the consumer install path). Fixed with a repo-local shim `components/aurora/attachment.ts` (`e28e960`).
5. Verified visually: chrome-devtools MCP needs X (unavailable); the agent-browser Chrome on :9222 is network-isolated from sandbox-local ports and its screenshot API stalls on background tabs; Playwright/Firefox crashed. Working recipe: :9222 Chrome + the Tailscale IP (`100.88.16.79:3777`) + `AURORA_DEV_ORIGIN` for Next dev assets + `Page.bringToFront` before `Page.captureScreenshot`.
6. User showed the CD Components view (manifest-driven live tiles) vs our gallery-sidebar link. Built the live catalog (`8e726c5`): extracted `app/gallery/demo-map.tsx` (shared slug→demo map), rebuilt `ComponentCatalog` with lazy scaled live previews + `LiveDrawer`, added `/components`, rewired nav/⌘K/pillar.
7. Added drawer prev/next arrows + ←/→ keys + n/total counter (`b8ae564`).
8. Replaced the header Components dropdown with an on-page shadcn·React / Android·Compose segmented toggle (`5e9a61e`); Android flavor driven by `lib/kotlin-map.ts` parsing `docs/component-kotlin-map.md` (120 counterparts; 125 catalog items ported).
9. Implemented suggestions 1–4 (`6303d5d`): light-mode pass over all new surfaces (found + fixed a swallowed space after a `<Strong>` in docs copy), ⌘K → `/components?c=slug` drawer deep-links, URL state via `history.replaceState` + `useSearchParams` watcher (Suspense-wrapped), mobile hamburger nav.
10. Fixed 4 errors reported from the live site (`8438afe`): catalog tile `<button>` wrapped demos containing buttons — invalid nesting caused 3 of the 4 errors (2 console + 1 hydration); converted tiles to `div[role=button]`. The 4th (`eval()` blocked) is dev-mode React only — identified that `aurora.tootie.tv` is served by the `dev` compose target on dookie.
11. Maintenance pass for this note: corrected the stale SWAG upstream claim in `CLAUDE.md` (`c8f9e79`).

## Key findings

- The CD page is a Babel-standalone SPA: `Aurora.html` loads `aurora-site/{app,palette,views,detail,live,registry,icons,data}.jsx`; the live catalog iframes per-component `components/<Name>/<Name>.dsCard.html` cards rendered by CD's vanilla `_ds_bundle.js`.
- dsCards must NOT be copied into the app: they render a parallel component implementation (split-brain with the registry). Their curated hero compositions are portable, though — recorded in `bd remember` key `catalog-preview-upgrade-option-declined-2026-07-02` (user declined the port).
- `origin/main` was un-buildable at session start: `registry/aurora/blocks/ai/elements/attachments.tsx:3` imported `@/components/aurora/attachment` (the consumer install target of `aurora-attachment` per `registry.json`), which didn't exist in-repo.
- Interactive content cannot nest inside `<button>`: the catalog tile button wrapping live demos re-parents markup during HTML parsing and fails hydration (errors seen on the live site's dev overlay).
- `aurora.tootie.tv` is served by the `aurora-design-system` **dev** container on **dookie** (compose `dev` target, `50000→3000`, bind-mounts the primary checkout) — merges go live with no deploy step; the `eval()` console error and dev overlay exist only because of dev mode. An unused `aurora-prod` standalone service exists in `docker-compose.yaml`.
- Environment: browsers on dookie cannot reach sandbox-local ports; the reliable headless capture path is the :9222 Chrome + Tailscale IP + `Page.bringToFront` (new-headless background tabs never paint, so `captureScreenshot` hangs forever without it).

## Technical decisions

- **Upstream-first:** generalized the registry `command-palette` block (backward-compatible `sections`/`placeholder`/`filter` props) instead of hand-rolling a site palette; rebuilt `public/r/aurora-command-palette.json`.
- **Single source for previews:** `app/gallery/demo-map.tsx` is shared by gallery pages and catalog tiles, so previews are the same components the gallery renders — no drift. Tile previews scale demos 0.31× inside a transformed wrapper (the transform doubles as a containing block for fixed-position demo content).
- **Counts derive, never hardcode:** docs registry count from `registry.json`; Kotlin flavor from `lib/kotlin-map.ts` parsing the authoritative table in `docs/component-kotlin-map.md` (throws at build if the format changes or <30 rows parse).
- **URL state via `history.replaceState`** (no history spam while typing) + `useSearchParams` watcher for ⌘K navigation; `ComponentCatalog` export wraps the inner component in `Suspense` for SSG.
- **CD adaptations:** ⌘K component selection opens the `/components` drawer (`?c=slug`) rather than CD's hero-inline iframe (no dsCard infrastructure); the Android flavor shows web-parity renders + Kotlin file names + gradle install rather than CD's Compose mocks.

## Beads activity

| id | title | actions | final status | why |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| aurora-design-system-7hkh | Port CD Aurora.html page chrome — ⌘K palette, Icons & Docs views, header parity (port phase 3) | created, claimed, closed | closed | main port work |

`bd dolt push` run after closures. Pre-existing in-progress epics `ybi2` (CD→registry conversion) and `cyuf` (design-sync back to CD) were not part of this session and remain open; note that this session's command-palette generalization makes the CD copy stale, which is exactly `cyuf`'s scope.

## Repository maintenance

- **Plans:** `docs/plans/` does not exist in this repo — no-op (evidence: `ls docs/plans` → no such directory).
- **Beads:** all three session beads closed with work verified (see above); no orphaned session work. Follow-ups are covered by existing epics or `bd remember`.
- **Worktrees/branches:** two worktrees registered — primary (`main`) and this one (`claude/upbeat-hypatia-14f9fe`); both at the same commit, branch fully merged into `main` via fast-forward pushes. Branch and worktree left in place because the worktree is the active session workspace; safe to remove later with `git worktree remove` + branch delete.
- **Stale docs:** `CLAUDE.md` SWAG upstream corrected (`tootie:50000` → dookie container, dev/prod services documented) — evidence: `docker ps` on dookie shows `aurora-design-system … 0.0.0.0:50000->3000`, and the user confirmed. No other doc contradictions observed.
- **Transparency:** the live SWAG conf on squirts (`aurora.subdomain.conf`) was not inspected; if its upstream host literally says `tootie`, it still resolves to the dookie container per observed behavior — flagged in Open Questions.

## Tools and skills used

- **DesignSync (claude.ai/design):** listed projects, fetched `Aurora.html` + 10 source files + a dsCard sample. Initially blocked until the user ran `/design-login`.
- **Skills:** `aurora:aurora-design-system` (design rules), `webwright` (invoked by user; its Playwright/Firefox path failed on this host — see Errors).
- **Bash/file tools:** all code edits, builds, tests, git.
- **CDP over raw Node WebSocket:** custom `shot.mjs`/inline scripts against the :9222 headless Chrome for screenshots and console-error capture (chrome-devtools MCP unusable headless; `agent-browser` mise shim broken).
- **Beads (`bd`):** issue tracking + `bd remember`.
- **SendUserFile:** delivered verification screenshots at each milestone.
- **Issues encountered:** chrome-devtools MCP needs an X server; the :9222 Chrome is namespace-isolated from sandbox-local ports and hangs `captureScreenshot` on background tabs (fixed with Tailscale IP + `bringToFront`); Playwright install/revision mismatch on Ubuntu 26.04 (see `~/docs/ai/webwright.md`) and Firefox crashed mid-run; `pkill` in a command chain kills its own wrapper (exit 144) — run it last/alone.

## Commands executed

| command | result |
|---|---|
| `pnpm install` (worktree) | node_modules populated (35s; worktree was cold) |
| `pnpm registry:build` | regenerated `public/r/*.json` |
| `pnpm lint` / `pnpm build` / `pnpm test:unit` / `pnpm audit:composition` | all green at every commit point (65/65 tests) |
| `AURORA_DEV_ORIGIN=100.88.16.79 pnpm dev --port 3777` | dev server for visual verification |
| `pnpm start --port 3778` | production server for console-clean verification |
| `git push origin claude/upbeat-hypatia-14f9fe:main` | fast-forward merges to main (×5) |
| `bd create/claim/close`, `bd dolt push` | bead lifecycle |

## Errors encountered

- **`main` build break (pre-existing):** `attachments.tsx` imported a consumer-only path → typecheck failure. Fixed via shim (`e28e960`).
- **Nested `<button>` (introduced by this session, caught from live site):** catalog tiles wrapped demos containing buttons → 2 console errors + hydration failure. Fixed (`8438afe`); production console verified clean on `/` and `/components`.
- **Swallowed space in docs copy:** `</strong>Selection` rendered without a space (JSX whitespace edge case) — made explicit with `{" "}` (`6303d5d`).
- **`eval()` console error on live site:** dev-mode React under CSP; not fixable in code — the site runs the `dev` compose target by design (instant updates via bind mount). Documented; `aurora-prod` service is the alternative.
- **Tooling detours:** blank/hung screenshots from the isolated :9222 Chrome (namespace + background-tab paint), Playwright Firefox crash, `mise` shim failure for `agent-browser`, `pkill` self-termination in chains. All worked around as described above.

## Behavior changes (before/after)

| area | before | after |
|---|---|---|
| Header nav | Overview, Components→gallery, Themes, Tokens | Components ▸ /components, Themes, Tokens, Icons, Docs + Search (⌘K) + mobile hamburger |
| /components | did not exist (gallery sidebar only) | live catalog: 162 tiles rendering real demos, fuzzy search, category chips, flavor toggle (shadcn / Android·Compose 125 ported), drawer with arrows + install lines |
| ⌘K | none | site-wide palette; component selection deep-links the drawer (`?c=slug`) |
| /icons, /docs | 404 | CD-parity views (Lucide + OperationIcon grid; 6 doc pages) |
| Catalog URL | stateless | `?flavor` / `?q` / `?c` shareable, restored on load |
| Landing catalog | text-only cards | live preview tiles (same component) |
| Console on live site | 4 errors | 1 (dev-mode `eval()` only; zero under a production build) |

## Verification evidence

| command / check | expected | actual | status |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pnpm build` (each commit) | pass | pass (`/components`, `/icons`, `/docs` + 5 static params in route table) | pass |
| `pnpm test:unit` | 65/65 | 65/65 | pass |
| CDP screenshots (dark) | CD-parity rendering | home/icons/docs/⌘K/split-menu/drawer/arrows/flavors verified | pass |
| CDP screenshots (`?theme=light`) | tokens remap | catalog/icons/docs/⌘K/mobile all clean | pass |
| `/components?c=buttons` | drawer opens from URL | drawer open, counter 6/162 | pass |
| Prod console (`/`, `/components`, next start) | no errors | "console clean" both | pass |
| Live `aurora.tootie.tv/components` post-merge | fix live | 162 `div[role=button]` tiles; only dev-mode eval error remains | pass |

## Risks and rollback

- All changes are additive site/registry-source work on `main`; rollback is `git revert` of any of `e28e960…c8f9e79`. The registry JSON change is regenerable (`pnpm registry:build`).
- `lib/kotlin-map.ts` reads `docs/component-kotlin-map.md` at build time and throws if the table section header changes — an intentional tripwire, but renaming that heading will fail builds until the parser is updated.
- The live site remains on the dev compose target (user's explicit choice); the `eval()` console error and dev overlay persist until `aurora-prod` is used.

## Decisions not taken

- **dsCard preview port (user declined):** curated per-component tile compositions exist in the CD project; mechanism + porting plan preserved via `bd remember`. Do not iframe the dsCards directly (split-brain).
- **Switching the live container to `aurora-prod`:** offered, declined implicitly — the dev bind-mount workflow is deliberate.
- **CD hero-inline component view (`HeroComponentView`):** adapted to drawer deep-links instead; no dsCard/iframe infra in the app.

## Open questions

- The SWAG conf on squirts (`aurora.subdomain.conf`) was not read; `CLAUDE.md` now documents the dookie container as the upstream based on `docker ps` + user confirmation — worth confirming the conf's literal upstream host next time someone touches it.
- Sparse tile previews (e.g. Direction) remain until/unless the dsCard composition port is revived.

## Next steps

- **None required** — all session work is merged, verified, and live.
- Optional follow-ons: revive the dsCard tile-composition port (`bd memories catalog-preview`), run `/design-sync` to push the generalized command-palette upstream changes back to the CD project (existing bead `cyuf`), and consider a `just deploy`-style rebuild script if the `aurora-prod` service is ever adopted.
- Cleanup when convenient: `git worktree remove .claude/worktrees/upbeat-hypatia-14f9fe` and delete branch `claude/upbeat-hypatia-14f9fe` (fully merged into `main`).
